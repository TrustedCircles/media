Sounds and graphics resources for Trusted Circles.

These are the resources we use in the app:
- Background image of the website: https://www.pexels.com/photo/city-walking-sidewalk-long-exposure-45922/
- Alarm: https://freesound.org/people/jamesabdulrahman/sounds/263621/
- New message: https://freesound.org/people/qubodup/sounds/221506/
- Watcher comes in: https://freesound.org/people/FoolBoyMedia/sounds/352657/
- Watcher comes out: https://freesound.org/people/Headphaze/sounds/277031/

Also you can use, distribute, copy and modify the svg files you'll encounter here, as well as the icons that are inside them.
Separated or not.
